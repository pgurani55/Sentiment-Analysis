Crust is not good.
The potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer.
"I tried the Cape Cod ravoli, chicken, with cranberry mmmm!"
Waitress was a little slow in service.
I could care less... The interior is just beautiful.
The cashier had no care what so ever on what I had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced.
I love the Pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try.
Omelets are to die for!
Everything was fresh and delicious!
It was probably dirt.
The warm beer didn't help.
Very good lunch spot.
"It was either too cold, not enough flavor or just bad."
"Seriously flavorful delights, folks."
"The service was not up to par, either."
I waited and waited.
I love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it.
